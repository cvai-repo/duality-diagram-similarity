Here we provide the code to replicate our results on Taskonomy and Pascal VOC transfer benchmark. You can also find the implementation of our old method published in CVPR 2019 based on RSA in these links [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.11740), [code](https://github.com/kshitijd20/RSA-CVPR19-release)

* To assess similarity between two tasks, we extract the features of the Deep Neural Networks(DNNs) trained on these tasks

* We then create the Duality Diagram of a task from extracted feature matrix.

* We finally compare the Duality Diagrams of two tasks to assess their similarity.

## Setup
* Code uses standard python libraries numpy, scipy, scikit-learn, pandas so it should run without installing additional libraries
* Download saved features of Taskonomy and Pascal VOC models from this <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/iqg7p97vxmqhkcz/AABwcbMYSZKb2euEIqFMWaLma?dl=0">link </a> , and save the features in ./features directory.
* Download taskonomy groundtruth transfer learning results for <a href="https://github.com/StanfordVL/taskonomy/blob/master/results/affinities/all_affinities.pkl">affinities</a> and <a href="https://github.com/StanfordVL/taskonomy/blob/master/results/winrates/wins_vs_pixels_16k.pkl">winrate</a> and save them in ./affinities folder

## Taskonomy
* Run ```python computeDDS_taskonomy.py``` to compute DDS between Taskonomy models
* Compare the DDS with transfer learning performance by running the jupyter notebook : DDS_vs_transferlearning(Taskonomy).ipynb
* The comparison results of DDS with transfer learning using Taskonomy images should be identical to Table below

## Pascal VOC
* Run ```python computeDDS_pascal.py``` to compute DDS between Taskonomy models and Pascal VOC model
* Compare the DDS with transfer learning performance by running the jupyter notebook : DDS_vs_transferlearning(Pascal).ipynb
* The comparison results of DDS with transfer learning using Pascal images should be identical to Table below
